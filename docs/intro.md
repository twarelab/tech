## Overview

The ‘Serial to Ethernet’ (S2E) Products are the gateway that converts
UART (TTL, RS-232 or RS-422/485) protocol into TCP/IP. It enables remote
gauging, managing and control of TCP/IP devices through a UART serial
interface.

WIZnet S2E module supports a wide range of pin header types and hardware
interfaces.
